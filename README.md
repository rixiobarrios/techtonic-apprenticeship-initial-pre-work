# APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING CLASS PRE-WORK ASSIGNMENT

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/221f9c25-49b4-440e-8b02-fa18a03b9a8e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/mock-up-exercise/deploys)

I have an existing Freecodecamp account since 09/09/19 [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/rixiobarrios)

I have previously completed the modules marked with [x]:

1. Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5 [x]28/28
2. Introduction to Basic CSS [x]44/44
3. Introduction to the CSS Flexbox Challenges [x]17/17
4. Introduction to the CSS Grid Challenges [ ]0/22
5. Introduction to Javascript [x]111/111
6. Introduction to the ES6 Challenges [ ]0/31

I will start making notes on the lessons I have not worked on yet.

## Introduction to the CSS Grid Challenges

Notes: Finished module without incident [x]22/22

## Introduction to the ES6 Challenges

**Set Default Parameters for Your Function**

Notes: It was not cleared to me as to what to do in terms of syntax with this exercise. My answer seem to resemble that of the example, but I was missing something. Looked at the Help "get a hint" section and realized I already tried the correct syntax but it did not work for some reason. Perhaps I was missing a comma or a semi-colon?

**Use the Rest Parameter with Function Parameters**

Note: I was a bit confused with the syntax and what the exercise was asking for, so after reading the exercise a few times over I went to the web and found something useful [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45tyvrHukUc)

**Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects**

Note: I commented out the previous ES5 syntax and it was giving me an error, so I just deleted it and left my answer alone. Had to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exLPAbmucD0&ab_channel=UsefulProgrammer) video to figure it out.

**Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Arrays**

Note: The concept was somewhat abstract to me so I had to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjcsoWdEPmQ&ab_channel=WeWillCode) video to understand it better.

**Create Strings using Template Literals**

Note: I was having trouble understanding why they were using the same variable names in two instances, a global and a local one. I had to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL6cf3hLpzQ&ab_channel=OmarShishani) to clear my confusion.

**Use getters and setters to Control Access to an Object**

Note: Missed the formula on the return for celsius. Figured it out by watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftR1YePDOc&ab_channel=WeWillCode) informative video to realize my simple mistake.

Notes: Finished with a few challenges noted above [x]31/31

### I have finished all the modules left as of 09/04/2020 9:53 PM

**Difficulties**

For this project I was able to advance without many issues, up to the point where I had to fit the whole contents of the container without any gaps. Also, I had issues making the website render everything in one page with no scrolling required.
